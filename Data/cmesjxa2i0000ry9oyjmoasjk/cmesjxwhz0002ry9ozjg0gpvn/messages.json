    "content": "1. B. Upgrading insulation and air sealing is typically the largest long-term reduction in residential energy use because it reduces heating and cooling loads across seasons, more impactful than LED lighting alone, solar only when feasible, and thermostat tweaks.\n2. Strategy 1: Replace single-use plastics with reusables (bags, bottles, containers) and buy in bulk where possible; challenges include habit changes and upfront costs; overcome by keeping a portable kit, planning shopping trips, and budgeting for durable options. Strategy 2: Choose products with minimal or refillable packaging and bring your own jars or bags; challenges include limited store options and availability; overcome by researching bulk stores and local refill points. Strategy 3: Repair, refurbish, and recycle to extend product life and reduce waste; challenges include time and skill gaps; overcome by joining local repair events, seeking simple repair guides, and supporting services that offer repairs. \n3. Strategy 1: Schedule short, regular social-media windows and disable non-essential notifications to reduce interruption and mood volatility. Strategy 2: Curate feeds by unfollowing or muting accounts that trigger negative emotions, following diverse, credible sources, and engaging mindfully with content; monitor sleep quality and mood as you test changes.\n4. B) Circular economy. It focuses on repairing, refurbishing, reusing, and local sourcing to keep materials at high value longer, reduce waste, and build resilient systems; contrast with linear models (take-make-dispose) and globalization-driven consumption.\n5. (a) Annual energy savings = (60 W \u00d7 4 h \u00d7 365 days) \u2212 (9 W \u00d7 4 h \u00d7 365 days) = 87.6 kWh \u2212 13.14 kWh = 74.46 kWh per year. (b) CO2 reduction \u2248 74.46 kWh \u00d7 0.92 lb/kWh \u2248 68.5 lb CO2 per year.\n6. Goal: a 7-day digital well-being plan for a college student. Day-by-day: Day 1 \u2013 set a daily screen-time target (e.g., 2 hours of social apps total) and no-phone hours after 10 pm; Day 2 \u2013 implement a 60-minute \u201cstudy block\u201d with phone off; Day 3 \u2013 replace one online habit with an offline activity (walk, workout); Day 4 \u2013 adjust notifications (only essential alerts); Day 5 \u2013 mindful scrolling practice (pause, reflect before reacting); Day 6 \u2013 social check-in with friend or therapist if distress arises; Day 7 \u2013 review mood and performance metrics. Boundaries: no phones in bed, 2\u20133 planned social sessions per week, 1 tech-free meal per day. Metrics: daily mood score, hours online, number of meaningful interactions, sleep quality, avoidance of procrastination incidents.\n7. Harms perspective: social media can increase anxiety, social comparison, doomscrolling, and sleep disruption; benefits perspective: can provide support networks, access to information, and community. Evidence strength is moderate for associations with mood and sleep; causality remains debated; gaps include long-term causal pathways and differential effects by platform, age, and usage patterns. Balanced view: use mindfully, curate feeds, maintain boundaries, and seek evidence-based guidelines; recognize both risks and opportunities while continuing to study causal impacts.\n8. Community program: Repair Caf\u00e9 and Tool Library pilot. Objectives: reduce waste, build local skills, foster community connections. Stakeholders: residents, local makers, library/municipal partners, sponsors. Activities: biweekly repair sessions, tool lending, upcycling workshops, awareness campaigns. Timeline: Month 1 \u2013 partner onboarding, locate venue, public kickoff; Month 2 \u2013 regular repair events, member sign-ups, tool inventory; Month 3 \u2013 evaluate usage, collect feedback, plan expansion. Metrics: number of items repaired, items lent, participant attendance, waste diverted (estimated), participant satisfaction, and repeat engagement rate."
